## üõ† Troubleshooting

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Chart appears squished or unreadable

**Symptoms:**
- Epoch labels are compressed and overlap.
- Happens when MEV rewards start only from a high epoch (e.g., 300+), with earlier epochs having no rewards.

**Explanation:**
- The chart currently includes all epochs, even those with zero rewards, which leads to long unreadable x-axis.

**Solution:**
- This is a known limitation. I plan to filter out epochs without rewards in a future update.
- For now, simply scroll horizontally or zoom out in the browser.


### 2. ‚ùå `500` Error or `Failed to fetch MEV rewards`

**Symptoms:**
- Error message appears after clicking **Load MEV**.
- No data is loaded into the chart.

**Possible reasons:**
- Invalid or inactive `votePubkey`.
- The Jito API endpoint is temporarily down or unreachable.

**Manual check:**
Visit this URL in your browser (replace `YOUR_VOTE_PUBKEY` with your actual key):
```
https://kobe.mainnet.jito.network/api/v1/validators/YOUR_VOTE_PUBKEY
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Compliance Notice

This tool:
- Uses only **public, unauthenticated** endpoints provided by the Jito Foundation
- Does **not** scan or compare other validators
- Displays data **only** for the `votePubkey` manually entered by the user

‚úÖ This implementation is **SFDP-compliant** and designed with network fairness and transparency in mind.
